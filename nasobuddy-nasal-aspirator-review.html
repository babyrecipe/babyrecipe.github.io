Letâs hear from hos own words as what was the spark behind creating Nasobuddy?</p> <p dir="ltr">â As new parents a few years back , we went through all the challenges of raising a newborn . The hardest challenge was our son was prone to colds , runny noses ,nose blocks ,sleepless nightsâŚ.often stretching to weeks.</p> <p dir="ltr">Our pediatrician recommended saline drops and a bulb aspirator to relieve the nose blocks.Â The bulb aspiratorÂ removed only a few drops of mucus and was no help at all in relieving our sons suffering.</p> <p dir="ltr">A cousin in the U.S told us about an manual nasal aspirator or snot suckerÂ which his hospital recommended. Though skeptical at first, our babyâs long spells of suffering made us desperate enough to use it. It worked instantly to remove the nose block, he fed and slept so well that night. We continued to use it on our son whenever he had a cold. It did not stop the cold or reduce its frequency. But it was a real lifesaver in clearing up our babyâs nose , to breathe and feed freelyâ.<br> The device was unavailable in India and had to be shipped in via an U.S online vendor.Â Cost us a couple of thousand rupees and it took us 3 weeks to have it delivered.<br> A useful device such as this should be made available in India at a more affordable price and readily accessible.</p> <h1 dir="ltr">Nasobuddy â Nasal Aspirator Review</h1> <p>As is every baby, my daughter is also prone to catch colds especially from my elder toddler.My 1 year old daughter is one big fussy lady who will suffer with blocked nose rather than us trying to help her remove the blocking mucus. She hates us doing anything invasive for her like using a bulb aspirator.</p> <div class="IYuyn8pU" style="clear:both;float:left;width:100%;margin:0 0 20px 0;"> <!-- Responsive --> <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5875724470271670" data-ad-slot="5527531547" data-ad-format="auto"></ins> <script></script> </div> <p>This Nasobuddy nasal aspirator worked as a wonder for her relieving the blocked nose instantly.</p> <p><img class=" aligncenter" src="" alt="Nasobuddy Review MyLittleMoppet" width="675" height="224" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt="" data-jpibfi-post-url="https://www.mylittlemoppet.com/nasobuddy-nasal-aspirator-review/" data-jpibfi-post-title="NasoBuddy â Nasal Aspirator Review" data-jpibfi-src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-UNf_8d-MMYc%2FVSjMEw546oI%2FAAAAAAAASR4%2FHpVDul8K6AM%2Fs1600%2FNasobuddy%252BReview%252Bcollage.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" srcset=""></p> <h4>What is Nasobuddy ?</h4> <p>Blocked nose in babies can be very troublesome with difficulty in nursing Â feeding, sleeping. This Nasobuddy nasal aspirator helps in removing the mucus thereby relieving blocked nose. It can be used from birth till 5 years of age.</p> <h4>How does Nasobuddy work in removing the Mucus?</h4> <p>Nasobuddy is non-invasive â instead of going inside the nose like the bulb, it forms a seal with the outside of the babyâs nostril (creating a vacuum). Parent-powered (mouth) suction is much stronger and more effective than the static suction of the <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-use-a-bulb-syringe-or-nasal-aspirator-to-clear-a-stuf_482.bc" target="_blank">bulb aspirators</a>.</p> <h4>Contents of the Nasobuddy Nasal Aspirator</h4> <p><img class=" aligncenter" src="" alt="Nasobuddy Review MyLittleMoppet" width="700" height="700" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt="" data-jpibfi-post-url="https://www.mylittlemoppet.com/nasobuddy-nasal-aspirator-review/" data-jpibfi-post-title="NasoBuddy â Nasal Aspirator Review" data-jpibfi-src="https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2F4.bp.blogspot.com%2F-3oI7lnWb7AA%2FVSjME7E0r5I%2FAAAAAAAASR8%2Fv_yVMslJnKo%2Fs1600%2Fnasobuddy%252BNasal%252Baspirator.jpg&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*" srcset=""></p> <p>1.

BPA Free</strong></span></h4> <p>Nasobuddy is made of non-allergenic, latex-free, BPA-free, and phthalate-free polypropylene. It is manufactured in eco friendly clean environment.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>2. Non Invasive</strong></span></p> <p>Unlike the bulb aspirator, the Nasobuddy is non invasive and there is no need to insert the collecting tube inside the nostril.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>3. Parent Powered Suction</strong></span></p> <p>The parent can control the suction according to the thickness of the mucus, whereas in bulb aspirator it is by pressure.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>4. HygieneÂ </strong></span></p> <p>The Nasobuddy nasal aspirator is very hygeinic to use, since there are filters provided which prevent the mucus and bacterial transfer from baby to parent and vice versa.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>5. Usage and Durability</strong></span></p> <p>The Nasobuddy Nasal Aspirator is made of durable materials and can last for a longer period of time.
