Always give either boiled or scrambled eggs, do not give half boiled or raw eggs in milk as it might cause indigestion and loose stools.</li> </ul> <hr> [pullquote]4 pm[/pullquote] <h3>Evening</h3> <p>After napping 1 glass of milk or biscuits</p> <hr> [pullquote]5.30 pm to 6 pm[/pullquote] <h3>Evening snack</h3> <ul> <li>Biscuits 2 to 3</li> <li>Ragi Kheer</li> <li>1 bread slice with either jam or butter.
